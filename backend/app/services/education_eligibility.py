"""Post-secondary education eligibility gate (shared by all matching endpoints).

A job may declare ``requires_post_secondary`` (boolean) under
``llm_job_attributes.attributes`` in Mongo; it is surfaced as a top-level
``requires_post_secondary`` key on the flat job dict by
:func:`app.jobs.documents.build_job_dict_from_ranked`.

The user side comes from ``MatchRequest.any_post_secondary_educ`` (0/1, optional).

Gate (applied uniformly across /match, /match_v2, /match_v3, /match_v4):
a user is **ineligible** for a job only when the job requires post-secondary
education *and* the user explicitly reported having none.

Fail-open by design — only positive evidence excludes:
* Job has no / false ``requires_post_secondary``  -> eligible (never hide a job
  that simply lacks the field).
* User did not supply ``any_post_secondary_educ`` (None) -> eligible; preserves
  behaviour for clients that omit the optional field. Only an explicit ``0`` excludes.
